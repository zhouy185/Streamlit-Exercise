# Medals Explorer (Streamlit + Plotly Exercise)

## Objective

In this exercise, you’ll build a simple interactive Streamlit app that uses Plotly to visualize Olympic medal data.
We will practice how to:

* Use Streamlit widgets to control app interactivity (selectboxes, checkboxes, columns)

* Display Plotly charts (bar and pie)

* Use a sample dataset from Plotly (px.data.medals_wide())

## What You’ll Build

You’ll create a Streamlit web app that allows users to:

* Select a medal type (gold, silver, or bronze)

* Choose which charts to display (bar chart, pie chart, or both**)

* Explore medal counts per nation using interactive Plotly visuals

* The layout will display two charts side by side.

## Deliverables:

* Make sure to edit and commit app.py and requirements.txt.
* Try to peploy on streamlit. If you can deploy it, provide the url to your web app below:
